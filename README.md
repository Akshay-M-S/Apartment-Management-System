# Apartment-Management-System
Apartment management system is a web based PHP project which provides a way for owners to register tenants in modern way rather than registering in registers. This project is the solution for apartment owners to manage the tenants in an easier and more convenient way. The administrator/developer, is able to view all the owners of their building’s apartment as well as their details. And be able to register owners of their purchased apartment. The administrator can also register a new building and apartments in them so that he/she can register owners when an apartment is sold. There will be a robust database which store all the data related to these various apartments and their related owner information. The basic structure is as follows, the project manages the tenants and keeps the rent payment records as well as maintain the tenants details. It helps to keep track of all the payments done by tenants. This tool will ease the user to manage huge data of different customers who own apartments from the same builder.
The proposed system is highly secure, it maintains records for all the apartments, manages rent of an apartment and tracking the payment due is made easy. There is also an archives of owner’s registration included so that there is no double registration encountered when a particular owner’s registration details are tampered with.

The proposed apartment management system provides a user-friendly and helpful means of registering and paying online without any confusions or problems that might occur usually.
In our system, the developer who has created the apartments can allot the apartment to owner’s, which solves the problem of dual ownership as our system checks if owner is already is allocated or not. The owners can issue the apartment to tenant and can set the rent for it. And the tenant can check the rent status and pay.
This is a more trustable and accurate way of handling data as there is a high risk of data loss or data corruption in keeping offline records.
Thus we say that our project is a trustable and accurate type of data management for apartment management and will be very helpful in real world.
The project teaches us the essential skills like:
• Understanding the database handling and query processing.
• Implement, analyse and evaluate the project developed for an application
• Demonstrate the working of different concepts of DBMS.

Below is the flow chart of modules used to implement the project,
